# File-Storage-System-using-Hybrid-Cryptography
A File Storage System using Hybrid Cryptography ensures secure file management by combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Files are encrypted using a fast symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES), while the symmetric key is secured with asymmetric encryption . The encrypted files and keys are stored in a  cloud platform like Firebase.
